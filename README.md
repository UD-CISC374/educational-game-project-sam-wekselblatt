# The Sorting Hat
## What's Happening?
There's been a terrible mixup at the local hat factory and a bunch of customers have gotten the wrong hats! 
As the manager of this factory, it's up to you to sort this out and make sure each customer has the right hat.
You'll have to follow company guidelines and sort the hats into order using the specified sorting algorithm.
Make sure you work well, if you move around too many hats without getting the order right the customers will leave upset.

## How to Play
The way you play is by dragging hats around to the different customers in line. 
Each time you move a hat your movement counter increases. If you make too many moves without getting the order right,
the round will end and the customers will leave unhappy.
After each round, your move limit will decrease.
Complete each round by sorting the hats. Complete 12 rounds to beat the game.

## Learning Goals
Help students understand sorting algorithms by providing a hands-on experience in the sorting process.
This game functions as its own teaching tool, as well as a supplemental tool to help reinforce
lessons students have learned in regards to sorting algorithms.
